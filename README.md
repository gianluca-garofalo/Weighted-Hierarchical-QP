# Weighted-Hierarchical-QP

![Build Status](https://github.com/gianluca-garofalo/Weighted-Hierarchical-QP/actions/workflows/cmake-single-platform.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

Weighted-Hierarchical-QP is a sophisticated solver designed to tackle prioritized quadratic programming problems.  
It combines task-based hierarchies and matrix decomposition techniques to handle both equality and inequality constraints with high numerical stability.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Task Management**: Aggregate multiple tasks with increasing priority levels.
- **Flexible Constraint Handling**: Supports both equality and inequality constraints.
- **Robust Numerical Methods**: Uses Cholesky decompositions, orthogonal decompositions, and call graph analysis.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs powered by Doxygen.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- C++20-compliant compiler.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org) version 3.22 or greater.
- [Eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) (â‰¥3.4.0)
- (Optional) [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl) and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) for documentation.

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a build directory inside the project root:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```
3. Configure the project with CMake:
   ```bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```
5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   ctest -C Release
   ```

## Usage

After building, you may integrate the solver as a library:
```cpp
#include <hqp.hpp>
// ...use the HierarchicalQP solver as documented in the API...
```

## Documentation Generation

This project leverages Doxygen for comprehensive API documentation. To generate the docs:

1. Ensure Doxygen (and Graphviz for diagrams) is installed.
2. Modify the Doxyfile if necessary.
3. Run the following command in the project root:
   ```bash
   doxygen Doxyfile
   ```
4. Open the generated `docs/index.html` in your browser to view detailed documentation.
