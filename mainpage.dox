 * # Weighted-Hierarchical-QP
 *
 * **Weighted-Hierarchical-QP** is a sophisticated solver designed to tackle prioritized quadratic programming problems.
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * This project combines task-based hierarchies with advanced matrix decomposition techniques 
 * to resolve both equality and inequality constraints with exceptional numerical stability.
 *
 * **Features include:**
 * - Hierarchical Task Management: Aggregates multiple tasks with different priority levels.
 * - Flexible Constraint Handling: Supports both equality and inequality constraints.
 * - Robust Numerical Methods: Uses Cholesky decompositions and orthogonal decompositions.
 * - Comprehensive Documentation: Built with Doxygen to offer full API insights and diagrams.
 *
 * ## Getting Started
 *
 * For instructions on installation, build, and usage, please refer to the [README.md](README.md).
 *
 * ## Contributing
 *
 * Contributions are welcome! For guidelines, see the CONTRIBUTING.md.
